This project aims to enhance communication stability for remote workers. It monitors and analyzes network issues using AI-driven diagnostics, then provides clear, step-by-step guidance to users without technical expertise. The AI acts as a domain expert, handling complex technical analysis while enabling non-technical users to implement effective solutions easily.
